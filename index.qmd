2. Thursday, 10:15-11:45, room 303k

## Grading

The course consists of two parts: lectures and exercise classes. Your final grade will be the average of the grades of these two parts. To obtain a grade for the exercise classes, you need to complete a homework project at the end of the semesterâ€”details to be announced.

## GitHub Repository

All course materials for the exercise classes will be available in the GitHub
repository:

[{{< var github >}}]({{< var github >}})

## Software Setup

The exercise classes require a minimal software setup:

1. Open <https://cran.r-project.org/>, and you will find links to R builds for different operating systems. Click on the link matching your operating system and choose the latest version of R. When using the Windows operating system, you will see a link "Install R for the first time ." Click on this link and then download the R installer. Run the installer and accept the default settings.

2. After installing R, open <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. If the web page recognizes your operating system, you will see a download button (right side of the page) for R studio. If the button does not appear, scroll down the page and find the installer appropriate for your operating system. 

3. Should you encounter difficulties installing R and R Studio, you can watch
these video guides:

- [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8kP7c_QbLA)
- [Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFEDEXWomI4)

4. Optionally, you can also download and install git. In case of difficulties, these videos may help.

5. **The following steps depend on git being installed**. Open R Studio and open a new project dialog: File -> New Project. In the 
dialog, click on the third option: version control. From the next menu, select git.

In the Repository URL field, paste the address of the course repository:

```
{{< var githubHttps >}}
```

Click on the Create Project button and wait for git R studio to clone the
repository and open the project.

6. The content of the GitHub repository will be updated continuously throughout
the semester. In order to download the new files or updated versions of already
existing files, you can use git pull. Open the git window in the upper right pane
of R studio and click the pull button. This will download all changes from the GitHub
repository to your local copy.

8. Note that if you have modified the files tracked by git that have changed
in the repository, git pull will fail with an error similar to this one:

To avoid this, you can roll back the file to its original state. Right-click
on the file in the git window and choose "revert."

9. In the exercise classes, we will use many functions from the `tidyverse` system and several other packages. Before accessing these packages' functionality, you need to install them first. Find the R console in R studio and paste the following line on the command line. Press enter to run it and wait for the installation to complete.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tsibble", "xts", "quantmod", "urca", "rugarch", "rmarkdown"))
```
